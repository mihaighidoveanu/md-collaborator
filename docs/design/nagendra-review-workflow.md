# Design: Non‑blocking reviewer workflow ("Nagendra")

**Status:** Approved plan, ready to execute.
**Audience:** The engineer/AI agent implementing this. Follow the phases in
order. Each phase is independently shippable and carries its own tests.
**Language note:** UI copy in English (matches existing `review.html`).

---

## 0. Why / the five requirements

The reviewer (call him "Nagendra") opens a review link for a PR and works on
its markdown. We want him to be able to:

1. **Review non‑blocking** — his work never overwrites the author's branch.
2. **See what changed since the last time he looked** at each file.
3. **Leave explanatory comments**, either anchored to a paragraph or free / general.
4. **His edits open a pull request** instead of committing to the branch directly.
5. **When upstream moved while he had unsent edits**, see a *three‑way* view:
   the base he started from, the new upstream content, and his own unsent edits.

### Decisions already locked (do not re‑litigate)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| D1 | When the reviewer submits, we create a **new branch off the PR head** and open a **PR that targets the original PR's head branch** (`sessions.head_branch`). His changes layer on top of the author's PR as a sub‑PR the author can merge. |
| D2 | The old "Approve → commit directly to the branch + lock" flow is **replaced** by the PR model in D1. There is no direct‑commit path anymore. |
| D3 | **Comments UI:** hovering a paragraph reveals a comment‑icon button; clicking it anchors a comment to that paragraph. A second button with the same icon sits **top‑right next to the editor** and creates a **free/general** comment (no anchor). |
| D4 | **Diff view opens by default** when the file changed upstream since the reviewer last saw it. If he *also* has unsent local edits to that file, show the **three‑way** view instead. |

---

## 1. Current architecture (what you are changing)

Read these before touching anything:

- `server/app.js` — wires `db` + `github` into the admin & review routers (dependency injection; tests swap in fakes).
- `server/db.js` — SQLite schema (`sessions`, `file_edits`, `file_visits`) + a light migration pattern (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` wrapped in `try{}catch{}`).
- `server/github.js` — the GitHub adapter. Exports exactly: `getPR, getPRFiles, getFileContent, commitChanges, getCurrentHeadSha`.
- `server/routes/review.js` — reviewer API (`GET /api/:token`, `GET/PUT /api/:token/files/*`, `POST /api/:token/approve`).
- `server/routes/admin.js` — session create/list/revoke.
- `server/middleware/session.js` — `requireSession` (active only) and `requireActiveOrApproved`.
- `server/lib/minimalDiff.js` — `reconstructMinimalContent(orig, saved)` + exported `lcsIndices(a, b)`. **Reuse `lcsIndices` for all diffing.**
- `server/lib/files.js` — `selectReviewableFiles` (markdown, non‑removed).
- `public/review.html` — the entire reviewer SPA (Toast UI editor, autosave, approve). One file, vanilla JS.
- `tests/helpers/fakeGithub.js` — in‑memory fake implementing the 5‑method adapter contract. **Every new adapter method must be added here too.**
- `tests/` — `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`; `helpers/server.js` boots the app with fakes; spec is `test-spec.md`.

### Key facts to internalize

- `file_edits.original_content` is the **base**: the content the reviewer first
  started editing from, captured on the *first* save and never overwritten
  (`COALESCE(original_content, excluded.original_content)`). This is exactly the
  "base" leg of the three‑way diff (req 5).
- `sessions.head_sha` is the PR head SHA captured at session creation. The
  current approve flow refuses (HTTP 409) if the live head SHA has moved. We are
  **replacing that refusal** with the three‑way reconciliation view.
- `commitChanges(owner, repo, branch, headSha, editedFiles)` builds a tree on
  top of `headSha` and force‑moves `heads/<branch>`. We will keep the
  tree/commit building but point it at a **new** branch.
- The reviewer is a single anonymous identity per session (the token *is* the
  identity). No multi‑user concerns inside one session.

---

## 2. Target architecture overview

```
Reviewer opens link
  └─ GET /api/:token                 → session + file list (+ per-file change flags)
  └─ GET /api/:token/files/<path>    → { mine?, base?, upstream, seen?, view, diff }
        view ∈ { plain | two_way | three_way }   ← drives default-open diff (D4)
  └─ PUT /api/:token/files/<path>    → autosave (unchanged)
  └─ comments:
        GET    /api/:token/comments
        POST   /api/:token/comments         { file_path?, anchor?, body }
        PATCH  /api/:token/comments/:id     { resolved }
        DELETE /api/:token/comments/:id
  └─ POST /api/:token/submit          → create branch + commit + open PR (D1/D2)
                                        returns { ok, pr_number, pr_url }
```

New server modules:

- `server/lib/diff.js` — pure diff helpers used by routes (so the browser only renders, never computes). Built on `lcsIndices`.
- GitHub adapter gains `createBranch` and `createPullRequest`.

Session status lifecycle becomes: `active → submitted` (terminal, PR opened) or
`active → revoked`. The string `approved` is **renamed to `submitted`**
everywhere (DB default stays `active`; code/tests/spec updated — see §8).

---

## 3. Data model changes (`server/db.js`)

Add to `SCHEMA` (new installs) **and** add idempotent `ALTER TABLE` migrations in
`createDb` for existing DBs (mirror the existing `try{...}catch{}` pattern).

### 3.1 `sessions` — record the PR we opened

```sql
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN submitted_pr_number INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN submitted_pr_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN submitted_branch TEXT;
```

### 3.2 `file_edits` — record which SHA the base came from

```sql
ALTER TABLE file_edits ADD COLUMN base_sha TEXT;   -- session.head_sha at first save
```

(`original_content` is the base content; `base_sha` records the SHA it was read
at, so we can tell whether upstream moved relative to the reviewer's base.)

### 3.3 Replace `file_visits` with a "seen snapshot" (req 2)

Keep the table name `file_visits` (it is referenced for the unopened‑files
warning) but give it memory of *what* was seen:

```sql
ALTER TABLE file_visits ADD COLUMN seen_content TEXT;
ALTER TABLE file_visits ADD COLUMN seen_sha TEXT;
-- visited_at already exists; we now UPDATE it on every open (see §5.2)
```

### 3.4 New table `comments` (req 3)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (
  id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  session_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_path    TEXT,                 -- NULL = session-level free comment
  anchor_text  TEXT,                 -- snapshot of the paragraph text; NULL = unanchored
  paragraph_index INTEGER,           -- 0-based paragraph index at creation time; NULL = unanchored
  body         TEXT NOT NULL,
  resolved     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY(session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id)
);
```

Anchoring strategy: store **both** `paragraph_index` (fast path) and
`anchor_text` (the paragraph's text, for *re‑anchoring* when paragraphs shift).
On render, try `paragraph_index`; if that paragraph's text no longer matches
`anchor_text`, fall back to locating the paragraph whose text equals
`anchor_text`; if neither matches, render the comment as **"detached"** in the
panel (still visible, just not pinned). Keep this logic in the browser.

---

## 4. GitHub adapter (`server/github.js`) + fake

Add two methods; keep the existing five.

```js
// Create a new ref heads/<newBranch> pointing at fromSha. Idempotent-ish:
// if the ref exists, append a numeric suffix until createRef succeeds.
async function createBranch(owner, repo, newBranch, fromSha) { /* octokit.git.createRef */
  // returns the branch name actually created
}

// Open a PR. Returns { number, html_url }.
async function createPullRequest(owner, repo, head, base, title, body) { /* octokit.pulls.create */ }
```

Update the `module.exports` list. Then mirror both in
`tests/helpers/fakeGithub.js`:

- Add `createBranch: []` and `createPullRequest: []` to the `calls` record.
- `createBranch(owner, repo, newBranch, fromSha)` → push the call, return
  `newBranch` (or `newBranch + '-2'` if a test pre‑seeds a collision).
- `createPullRequest(...)` → push the call, return
  `{ number: 1000 + calls.createPullRequest.length, html_url: 'https://github.com/.../pull/<n>' }`.
- Honor a `config.submitShouldFail` flag (throw) analogous to `commitShouldFail`,
  so req‑11‑style "PR creation failed → session stays open" can be tested.

---

## 5. Server routes (`server/routes/review.js`)

### 5.1 `server/lib/diff.js` (new, pure, unit‑tested)

```js
const { lcsIndices } = require('./minimalDiff');

// Inline line diff: returns an ordered list of rows.
// row = { type: 'eq' | 'add' | 'del', text }
function lineDiff(oldText, newText) { /* walk lcsIndices like reconstructMinimalContent does */ }

// Three-way alignment keyed on the common BASE.
// Returns rows aligned by base line:
//   { base, upstream, mine,
//     upstreamChanged: bool, mineChanged: bool, conflict: bool }
// conflict = base line changed on BOTH sides to different values.
function threeWay(baseText, upstreamText, mineText) { /* LCS(base,upstream) + LCS(base,mine), align on base index */ }

module.exports = { lineDiff, threeWay };
```

Keep it line‑based (markdown is line‑oriented and `lcsIndices` is already
line‑based via the callers). Do **not** pull in an npm diff library.

### 5.2 `GET /api/:token/files/*` — now change‑aware

Replace the current handler body. Steps:

1. Validate the path is in the reviewable set (unchanged — keep the 404).
2. Load `edit` (content + original_content + base_sha) and the `file_visits`
   row (seen_content + seen_sha) for this `(session, path)`.
3. Fetch **current upstream** content via
   `github.getFileContent(owner, repo, path, liveHeadSha)` where `liveHeadSha =
   await github.getCurrentHeadSha(owner, repo, session.head_branch)`. (Falls back
   to `session.head_sha` if that call fails.)
4. Decide `view`:
   - `mine` exists (a dirty edit) **and** upstream differs from the edit's
     `original_content` → `view = 'three_way'`; payload `{ base: original_content,
     upstream, mine: content, diff: threeWay(base, upstream, mine) }`. **(req 5)**
   - else if a prior `seen_content` exists and differs from `upstream` →
     `view = 'two_way'`; payload `{ seen: seen_content, upstream,
     diff: lineDiff(seen_content, upstream) }`. **(req 2 / D4)**
   - else `view = 'plain'`; payload `{ content: mine ?? upstream, source }`.
5. **After** computing the response, update the seen snapshot (so "since last
   time" advances): `INSERT … ON CONFLICT(session_id,file_path) DO UPDATE SET
   seen_content = excluded.seen_content, seen_sha = excluded.seen_sha,
   visited_at = excluded.visited_at`. Store `upstream` as the new `seen_content`.
   Do this only when `session.status = 'active'` (read‑only sessions don't
   advance the watermark). **Remove the old `DO NOTHING`.**

> The response always includes `view` plus the editable text the front‑end
> should load into Toast UI as `content` (= `mine ?? upstream`), so the editor
> still works even when a diff is shown alongside.

### 5.3 `PUT /api/:token/files/*` — record `base_sha`

Unchanged except: when writing `original_content` for the first time, also write
`base_sha = session.head_sha`. Keep the `COALESCE`/first‑write‑wins semantics for
both columns.

### 5.4 Comments endpoints (new)

All under `requireSession` **except GET**, which uses `requireActiveOrApproved`
(so comments remain visible after submit).

- `GET /api/:token/comments` → all rows for the session, ordered by `created_at`.
- `POST /api/:token/comments` body `{ file_path?, anchor_text?, paragraph_index?, body }`
  → insert; `body` required and non‑empty (400 otherwise); returns the row.
- `PATCH /api/:token/comments/:id` body `{ resolved: bool }` → update, scoped to
  the session (404 if the comment isn't in this session).
- `DELETE /api/:token/comments/:id` → delete, scoped to the session.

### 5.5 `POST /api/:token/submit` — replaces `/approve` (D1/D2)

Rename the route from `approve` to `submit`. New behavior:

1. Save‑pending is handled client‑side (as today). Load dirty files
   (`file_path, content, original_content`).
2. If there are **no** dirty files: set `status='submitted'` and return
   `{ ok: true, submitted: false }` (clean close, no PR — mirrors the old
   "approve with no edits" rule).
3. Compute `liveHeadSha = getCurrentHeadSha(owner, repo, head_branch)`.
   - **Do not 409 on mismatch.** The three‑way view already surfaced upstream
     drift per file. Build commits off `liveHeadSha` so we never clobber.
4. `newBranch = await github.createBranch(owner, repo,
   \`review/pr${pr_number}-${token.slice(0,8)}\`, liveHeadSha)`.
5. Reconstruct minimal content per dirty file with
   `reconstructMinimalContent(original_content, content)` (unchanged helper) and
   `commitChanges(owner, repo, newBranch, liveHeadSha, files)`.
6. Open the PR: `createPullRequest(owner, repo, head=newBranch,
   base=head_branch, title=\`Review: ${pr_title}\`, body=<comment summary>)`.
   The body lists the reviewer's comments (anchored ones quoted) so they travel
   with the PR. Persist `submitted_pr_number/url/branch` on the session.
7. Set `status='submitted'`. Return `{ ok: true, submitted: true, pr_number,
   pr_url }`.
8. On any GitHub failure: leave `status='active'`, return 500 — never a
   half‑submitted session (mirrors existing req‑11 safety; covered by
   `config.submitShouldFail`).

> Comments are stored locally and summarized into the PR body. (Posting them as
> GitHub *inline review comments* requires mapping paragraphs → diff line numbers
> and is explicitly **out of scope** — note it as a future enhancement.)

### 5.6 `middleware/session.js`

Replace the `'approved'` checks/strings with `'submitted'`. Messaging:
`requireSession` rejects `submitted` with "This review has already been
submitted." Keep `requireActiveOrApproved` (rename to
`requireActiveOrSubmitted`) so reading/comments still work post‑submit.

---

## 6. Reviewer UI (`public/review.html`)

This is the largest piece. Keep it in the single file, vanilla JS, matching the
existing style. Sub‑tasks:

### 6.1 Submit button

Rename "Approve Changes" → "**Submit for PR**". On success, show a banner:
"Opened pull request #N → `<head_branch>`" linking to `pr_url`. Replace the
approved/`showApprovedState` naming with submitted equivalents. The
unopened‑files warning modal stays.

### 6.2 Default‑open diff view (D4, req 2 & 5)

When `openFile` fetches a file, branch on the response `view`. The editor is
**never gated behind a button** — diffs surface as a collapsible **reference
pane above the editor**, and editing always proceeds from `upstream`:

- `plain` → load `content` into Toast UI; no reference pane.
- `two_way` → show the reference pane with `lineDiff(seen, upstream)` (added lines
  green, removed red, GitHub‑style) — informational "here's what moved since you
  last looked" — and mount the editor on `upstream`.
- `three_way` → show the reference pane as a **3‑column** view: **Original |
  Upstream (author) | Your edits**, aligned by the `diff` rows from `threeWay`;
  highlight cells differing from base, mark `conflict` rows amber. Mount the
  editor on `upstream`. Editing **always continues from upstream** — the reviewer
  can never drop the author's changes wholesale by taking their own stale‑based
  version. The "Your edits" column is reference: they re‑apply those changes on
  top of upstream by hand, and the result autosaves as usual. (Rationale:
  committing a mine‑based version would revert any *other* lines the author
  changed upstream; re‑applying onto upstream cannot.)

The reference pane is height‑bounded and collapsible (Hide/Show) so it never
crowds out the editor. On a read‑only **submitted** session no reference pane is
shown — there is nothing to reconcile.

Implement the diff renderer as plain DOM tables/divs from the server‑provided
`diff` arrays — **no client‑side diff computation**. Add minimal CSS following
the existing palette (greens `#dcffe4/#22863a`, reds `#ffeef0/#cb2431`, amber for
conflict).

### 6.3 Comments (D3, req 3)

- **Paragraph hover button:** add a ProseMirror‑level affordance — on hover over
  a block node in the WYSIWYG surface, show a small comment‑icon button at the
  paragraph's right edge. Clicking it opens a small composer; on submit, POST a
  comment with `file_path = currentFile`, `paragraph_index` = that block's index
  among top‑level blocks, `anchor_text` = the paragraph's text.
  - Simplest robust implementation: a `mouseover`/`mouseout` listener on the
    editor's contenteditable root that positions a floating button next to the
    hovered top‑level block element; compute `paragraph_index` by counting prior
    sibling blocks. (You do **not** need a custom ProseMirror plugin for this;
    DOM positioning over the rendered blocks is acceptable and simpler.)
- **General comment button:** a button with the **same comment icon**, placed
  **top‑right next to the editor** (in `#header-actions`, left of Submit). Click
  → composer → POST with `file_path = currentFile` (or `null` for a truly
  session‑wide note — pick `currentFile` when a file is open, `null` when none),
  `anchor_text = null`, `paragraph_index = null`.
- **Comments panel:** a right‑hand collapsible panel listing comments for the
  current file (anchored ones near the top, with the quoted `anchor_text`), plus
  general comments. Each row: body, relative time, resolve toggle (PATCH),
  delete (DELETE). Re‑anchor on render per §3.4. Clicking an anchored comment
  scrolls to / highlights its paragraph.
- Load comments in `init()` and after each file open; keep a client cache.

### 6.4 Read‑only after submit

When `status === 'submitted'`: editor read‑only (reuse the existing
contenteditable=false path), diff/3‑way panels still viewable, comments
viewable but composer hidden, Submit button shows "Submitted".

---

## 7. Admin surface (`server/routes/admin.js`, `public/admin.html`)

- `GET /sessions`: the `edits_count` subquery is fine. Add `submitted_pr_number`
  / `submitted_pr_url` to the SELECT and show "PR #N" with a link in
  `admin.html` once a session is submitted. Update any `status === 'approved'`
  display strings to `submitted`.
- Revoke is unchanged (only `active` → `revoked`).

---

## 8. Spec & test deltas (`test-spec.md` + `tests/`)

Update the spec and tests **within each phase**, not at the end. Specific
requirement changes:

- **REQ‑9 (was "Approval commits & closes")** → reframe to "**Submission opens a
  PR and closes the session**":
  - Submitting with edits creates **one new branch**, **one commit**, and **one
    PR** targeting `head_branch`; session becomes `submitted`. Assert via fake
    `calls.createBranch`, `calls.commitChanges` (length 1, branch = new branch),
    `calls.createPullRequest` (head = new branch, base = head_branch).
  - Submitting with no edits closes cleanly, **no branch/PR created**.
- **REQ‑11 (conflict safety)** → change meaning:
  - R11.1 no longer "refuse on advanced branch". Instead: when upstream advanced,
    the file GET returns `view: 'three_way'` (or `two_way`) — assert the payload.
    Submission still succeeds by branching off the **live** head SHA (assert
    `commitChanges` was called with the live SHA, not the stale `session.head_sha`).
  - R11.2 keeps: if PR creation/commit fails (`submitShouldFail`), session stays
    `active`.
- **REQ‑12 (read‑only lock)** → `submitted` (not `approved`) is read‑only: edit &
  re‑submit refused.
- **New REQ‑15 — Change awareness (req 2):** after a reviewer has seen a file,
  if upstream changes, the next GET returns `view: 'two_way'` with a diff of
  seen→upstream; an unchanged file returns `view: 'plain'`.
- **New REQ‑16 — Three‑way (req 5):** with a dirty local edit *and* upstream
  drift, GET returns `view: 'three_way'` with `{ base, upstream, mine }` and a
  `diff` whose conflict rows are flagged correctly.
- **New REQ‑17 — Comments (req 3):** create anchored + free comments; list,
  resolve, delete; comments are scoped to their session (cannot touch another
  session's comment); body required.
- **New unit tests** for `lib/diff.js`: `lineDiff` add/remove/unchanged;
  `threeWay` conflict vs non‑conflict alignment, including duplicate lines
  (reuse the duplicate‑line rigor already in `minimalDiff.test.js`).

Test mechanics: integration tests boot via `tests/helpers/server.js` with
`createFakeGithub`. Extend fixtures with `headShas` overrides (already
supported) to simulate upstream drift, and add `contents` for the live SHA.
E2E (`tests/e2e/review.spec.js`, Playwright) gets: a default‑open diff scenario,
a 3‑way scenario, the paragraph‑hover comment flow, and the submit→PR banner.

---

## 9. Execution order (phased; ship each phase green)

| Phase | Scope | Files |
|------|-------|-------|
| **P0 Foundation** | Schema migrations (§3), adapter `createBranch`/`createPullRequest` + fakes (§4), `lib/diff.js` + its unit tests (§5.1) | `db.js`, `github.js`, `lib/diff.js`, `tests/helpers/fakeGithub.js`, `tests/unit/diff.test.js` |
| **P1 Submit→PR** | Replace approve with submit (§5.5), middleware rename (§5.6), UI submit button + banner (§6.1), admin PR link (§7), REQ‑9/11/12 test updates (§8) | `routes/review.js`, `middleware/session.js`, `review.html`, `admin.js`, `admin.html`, `test-spec.md`, integration tests |
| **P2 Change‑aware GET** | Seen snapshots + `view` decision + default‑open two‑way diff (§5.2, §6.2), REQ‑15 | `routes/review.js`, `review.html`, tests |
| **P3 Three‑way** | three_way payload + 3‑column reconcile UI (§5.2 branch, §6.2), REQ‑16 | `routes/review.js`, `review.html`, tests |
| **P4 Comments** | endpoints (§5.4), hover + general comment UI + panel (§6.3), REQ‑17 | `routes/review.js`, `review.html`, tests |

Within a phase: write/adjust tests alongside code; run `npm test` (node test
runner) and, for UI phases, `npm run test:e2e`. Do not start the next phase
until the current one is green.

---

## 10. Acceptance checklist (definition of done)

- [ ] Reviewer never writes to the PR's own branch; submitting opens a PR
      `review/pr<N>-<token>` → `<head_branch>` with a single commit. *(req 1, 4)*
- [ ] Reopening a file that moved upstream shows a diff **by default**; an
      unchanged file opens straight into the editor. *(req 2)*
- [ ] A file with unsent local edits **and** upstream drift opens in a 3‑column
      Base/Upstream/Mine view with conflicts flagged; the reviewer can resolve
      and the result autosaves. *(req 5)*
- [ ] Hovering a paragraph reveals a comment button that anchors a comment to it;
      the top‑right button creates a general comment; both list, resolve, delete.
      *(req 3)*
- [ ] Submitting with no edits closes the session cleanly with no branch/PR.
- [ ] A GitHub failure during submit leaves the session `active`.
- [ ] `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` pass; `test-spec.md` reflects the new
      REQ‑9/11/12 semantics and adds REQ‑15/16/17.

---

## 11. Explicitly out of scope (note, don't build)

- Posting comments as GitHub **inline review comments** (paragraph→diff‑line
  mapping). Comments live in the tool and are summarized into the PR body.
- Multiple distinct reviewer identities within one session.
- Real‑time collaboration / live cursors.
- Auth changes to the admin surface.
